It must have been around Christmas time as this time is known to be very busy in terms of clients. The sales hall was filled with waiting clients to withdraw money. Two advisors, of which one should have been in the sales hall as well, were in an office advising a client. This client was a former employee of this bank and that very same branch. The councelling continued for an unusual long time, which made it obvious that the advisors were also chatting privately rather than being eager to come back into the sales hall to take care of the flood of customers. While serving the customers I was also supervising the apprentice at the cash desk next to me, while coordinating the customers in line. Slightly enerved I went over to the office with the employees inside and made them aware of the situation, asking them to please have at least one of them coming to the sales hall, as it does not take so many advisors for this client (the former employee). In the room was also the head of the whole branch, which I did not know. My plea was ignored and I had to continue for another 30min to do the job for 3 people. It was a very frustrating situation.

I was the batsman and was supposed to play for 3 remaining deliveries and score two boundaries. The other team's goal was to just stop me by throwing not normal deliveries or confuse me. I was thinking to focus on the ball irrespective of the field setting. I was a bit nervous but also excited because of the cheers from my team mates. The only freeedom what I had was to focus and hit the ball in the direction where there were no player and the problem was the uncertainty in the extent to which the baller will change the delivery. I was trying to predict beforehand and fortunately managed to score two boundaries in the last over.  ,,,,166,166,Which part of brain is more active ?             ,impulse/activity in brain when one does a mistake,,no,,no,Male,Indian,Hindi,166,166
